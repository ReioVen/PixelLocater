Welcome to my personal solution for pixel locating!


Box Finder
It's a simple script in Python to help you locate pixels, 
by starting the script and pressing O you will be thrown into a
pixel finder loop, f to set the top and left of you screen
so select the top left of the spot you want to find first,
afterwards go to the bottom right of your location and press T,
after that you can press U to calculate the Left, Top and
Width, Height.
